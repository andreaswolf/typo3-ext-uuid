This extension does not offer a way to automatically generate UUIDs for new/existing records.
You currently have to do this by hand,
e.g. when creating records via `Doctrine Migrations for TYPO3 <https://github.com/andreaswolf/typo3-ext-migrations/>`.

Find a list of `open issues on Github
<https://github.com/andreaswolf/typo3-ext-uuid/issues>`__.
